Sector Rotation Analyzer

This project is an end-to-end machine learning and full-stack system that analyzes financial markets to detect sector leadership and capital rotation. Using sector and market price data, the system engineers features such as short-term returns, relative strength, and volatility, then applies K-Means clustering to group sectors into behavioral categories like outperforming, neutral, and underperforming. These clusters provide a structured view of market conditions and highlight which parts of the market are leading or lagging at any given time.

Beyond clustering, the platform models how capital shifts between sectors by tracking changes in rolling relative strength rankings over time. A FastAPI backend performs the quantitative computations, while a React + TypeScript frontend uses Plotly to render interactive 3D cluster visualizations and sector rotation flows. The result is an intelligent analytics dashboard that combines machine learning, time-series modeling, and data visualization — similar to tools used in quantitative research and trading environments.
